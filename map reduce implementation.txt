PRACTICAL 2
MapReduce Implementation Aim:
Implement word count / frequency programs using MapReduce.
Steps:
C:\hadoop-3.3.0\sbin>start-dfs.cmd
C:\hadoop-3.3.0\sbin>start-yarn.cmd
Open a command prompt as administrator and run the following command to create an input
and output folder on the Hadoop file system, to which we will be moving the sample.txt file
for our analysis.
C:\hadoop-3.3.0\bin>cd\
C:\>hadoop dfsadmin -safemode leave
DEPRECATED: Use of this script to execute hdfs command is deprecated.
Instead use the hdfs command for it.
Safe mode is OFF
C:\>hadoop fs -mkdir /input_dir
Check it by giving the following URL at browser
http://localhost:9870
Utilities -> browse the file system
Copy the input text file named input_file.txt in the input directory (input_dir)of HDFS.
Make a file in c:\input_file.txt and write following content in it.
Hadoop Window version is easy compared to Ubuntu version
Now apply the following command at c:\>
C:\> hadoop fs -put C:/input_file.txt /input_dir
Verify input_file.txt available in HDFS input directory (input_dir).
C:\>Hadoop fs -ls /input_dir/
Verify content of the copied file
C:\>hadoop dfs -cat /input_dir/input_file.txt
You can see the file content displayed on the CMD.
Run MapReduceClient.jar and also provide input and out directories.
C:\>hadoop jar C:/hadoop-3.3.0/share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-
examples3.3.0.jar wordcount /input_dir /output_dir
In case, there is some error in executing then copy the file MapReduceClient.jar in C:\ and
run the program with the jar file using existing MapReduceClient.jar file as:
C:\> hadoop jar C:/MapReduceClient.jar wordcount /input_dir /output_dir
Now, check the output_dir on browser as follows:
Click on output_dir part-r-00000 Head the file (first 32 K) and check the file content as the
output.
Alternatively, you may type the following command on CMD window as:
C:\> hadoop dfs -cat /output_dir/*
You can get the following output
