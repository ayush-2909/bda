Logistic Regression
Aim:
a) Import data from web storage â€“ binary.csv. Name the dataset and do Logistic Regression to
find out relation between variables that are affecting the admission of a student in an institute
based on his or her GRE score, GPA obtained and rank of the student. Also check the model
is fit or not.
Code:
#fetch the data
college <-
read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csquared/udacitydlnd/maste
r/nn/binary.csv") head(college)
nrow(college)
install.packages("caTools") # For Logistic regression library(caTools)
split <- sample.split(college, SplitRatio = 0.75) split
training_reg <- subset(college, split == "TRUE") test_reg
<- subset(college, split == "FALSE")
# Training model fit_logistic_model
<- glm(admit ~ ., data
= training_reg,
family = "binomial")
# Predict test data based on model predict_reg
<- predict(fit_logistic_model,
test_reg, type = "response")
predict_reg
cdplot(as.factor(admit)~ gpa, data=college) cdplot(as.factor(admit)~
gre, data=college)
cdplot(as.factor(admit)~ rank, data=college)
# Changing probabilities
predict_reg <- ifelse(predict_reg >0.5, 1, 0) predict_reg
# Evaluating model accuracy #
using confusion matrix
table(test_reg$admit, predict_reg)
